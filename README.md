# Voice-Based Book Recommendation System

A voice-interactive book recommendation system powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project takes user queries via speech, processes the input using NLP techniques, and recommends relevant books using content-based filtering methods such as **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity**.

## Features

- **Voice-based input**: Users can speak their preferences or queries.
- **NLP-powered engine**: Preprocesses text for improved accuracy using:
  - Tokenization
  - Stop word removal
  - Lemmatization
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text into numerical feature vectors.
- **Cosine Similarity Matching**: Finds the most similar books based on user input.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends books based on description similarity, not ratings.
